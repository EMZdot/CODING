  <div class="about">
    <a>We’re here to make people connect.
      Everyone has to write their own story. That’s why we get up in the morning.
      To bring people together. To match them. We put our heart and soul into matching our members.
      We empower our singles and get them on dates. Our community is our extended family.
      When we get thank you letters from our happy couples, we love to send them around the office and
      share the happiness.Our love finder allows you to discover potential parterns and life companions.
      <br></br>In normal every-day circumstances it would not be possible for common people to get in
      touch with an inmate, we give you the opportunity to find a special person that is waiting only for you.
